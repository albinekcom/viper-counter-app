# Counter #

Counter is a simple app showing the basics of the [VIPER](http://mutualmobile.github.io/blog/2013/12/04/viper-introduction/) [architecture](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/viper.html), a version of Uncle Bob’s [Clean](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2011/11/22/Clean-Architecture.html) [Architecture](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) for iOS apps. Counter shows the use of a View, Presenter and Interactor. It does not make use of a data store or a Wireframe for navigation.

The inspiration for Counter comes from Jon Reid’s UIViewController TDD [screencast](http://qualitycoding.org/uiviewcontroller-tdd/).
